                There are 6 distinct pieces in chess. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First we have the pawn there are total 8 pawns for each player so total of 16 pawn on the board</li>
                <li>The rook - Its an important piece which has 5 points and there 2 rooks for each player.</li>
                <li>The bishop - Its also a powerful piece and has 3 points, each player has 2 bishops on dark squared and light sqauared</li>
                <li>The kight (horsey) - This piece comes with an advantage to jump over other pieces we will see how below there are 2 horses for each player each has 3 points</li>
                <li>The Queen - the most powerful piece with 9 points each player has one queen at the start</li>
                <li>The King - The piece on which the whole game is actually played</li>
            </ol>

                            <h2><img src="pieces/Wpawn.png" alt="">Pawn:</h2>
                            <p>The pawns are the most basic and fundamental chessmen in the entire game.<br>It moves one step forward only, but if its the first move of pawn then, it can move 2 steps forward.<br>
                            The pwan has a special advantage over other piece i.e it can promote to either a Queen, Rook, Bishop or a Knight<br>Also there is one special move called En Passant that the pwan can do, where when the pawn can capture opponent pawn which has its first move as 2 steps forward provided that both the pawn are besides each other</p>
