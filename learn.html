            <p>
                There are 6 distinct pieces in chess.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First we have the pawn there are total 8 pawns for each player so total of 16 pawn on the board</li>
                <li>The rook - Its an important piece which has 5 points and there 2 rooks for each player.</li>
                <li>The bishop - Its also a powerful piece and has 3 points, each player has 2 bishops on dark squared
                    and light sqauared</li>
                <li>The kight (horsey) - This piece comes with an advantage to jump over other pieces we will see how
                    below there are 2 horses for each player each has 3 points</li>
                <li>The Queen - the most powerful piece with 9 points each player has one queen at the start</li>
                <li>The King - The piece on which the whole game is actually played</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let's take a look at the board.</p>
            <div class="about-board">
                <p>The board contains 8 rows and 8 columns, rows are called as ranks and columns are called as files.
                    There are 64 four squares in total.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The pawns are the most basic and fundamental chessmen in the entire game.
                        </li>
                        <img class="pawn-move-gif" src="Assets/pawn-moves-promotesgif.gif" alt="pawn-moves-gif">
                        <li>
                            It moves one step forward only, but if its the first move of pawn then, it can move
                            2 steps forward. It captures piece diagonally.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The pawn has a special advantage over other piece i.e it can promote to either a
                            Queen, Rook, Bishop or a Knight when it reaches the opposite end of the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also there is one special move called En Passant that the pwan can do, where when
                            the pawn can capture opponent pawn which has its first move as 2 steps forward
                            provided that both the pawn are besides each other.</p>
                        </li>
